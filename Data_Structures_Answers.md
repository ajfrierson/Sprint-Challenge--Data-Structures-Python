Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's append method?

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's append function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's get method?

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's get method?

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in names.py? Since there is a nested for-loop in the original names.py the runtime complexity will be O(n^2). The code will need to loop through both lists. Since the lists are the same size n^2 is appropriate.

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in names.py? The space complexity is probably O(n) since the memory required to run this algorithm should grow in proportion to the number of inputs.

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in names.py? O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in names.py? The space complexity of this is probably also O(n) as the memory requires should grow linearly with the inputs entered.
